      <h2>About World</h2>
      <p>In its most general sense, the term "world" refers to the totality of entities, to the whole of reality or to everything that is.[1] The nature of the world has been conceptualized differently in different fields. Some conceptions see the world as unique while others talk of a "plurality of worlds". Some treat the world as one simple object while others analyze the world as a complex made up of many parts. In scientific cosmology the world or universe is commonly defined as "[t]he totality of all space and time; all that is, has been, and will be". Theories of modality, on the other hand, talk of possible worlds as complete and consistent ways how things could have been. Phenomenology, starting from the horizon of co-given objects present in the periphery of every experience, defines the world as the biggest horizon or the "horizon of all horizons". In philosophy of mind, the world is commonly contrasted with the mind as that which is represented by the mind. Theology conceptualizes the world in relation to God, for example, as God's creation, as identical to God or as the two being interdependent. In religions, there is often a tendency to downgrade the material or sensory world in favor of a spiritual world to be sought through religious practice. A comprehensive representation of the world and our place in it, as is commonly found in religions, is known as a worldview. Cosmogony is the field that studies the origin or creation of the world while eschatology refers to the science or doctrine of the last things or of the end of the world.

In various contexts, the term "world" takes a more restricted meaning associated, for example, with the Earth and all life on it, with humanity as a whole or with an international or intercontinental scope. In this sense, world history refers to the history of humanity as a whole or world politics is the discipline of political science studying issues that transcend nations and continents. Other examples include terms such as "world religion", "world language", "world government", "world war", "world population", "world economy" or "world championship".</p>

      <h2>Etymology</h2>
      <p>The English word world comes from the Old English weorold. The Old English is a reflex of the Common Germanic *weraldiz, a compound of weraz 'man' and aldiz 'age', thus literally meaning roughly 'age of man';[2] this word also led to Old Frisian warld, Old Saxon werold, Old Dutch werolt, Old High German weralt, and Old Norse verÇ«ld.[3]

The corresponding word in Latin is mundus, literally 'clean, elegant', itself a loan translation of Greek cosmos 'orderly arrangement'. While the Germanic word thus reflects a mythological notion of a "domain of Man" (compare Midgard), presumably as opposed to the divine sphere on the one hand and the chthonic sphere of the underworld on the other, the Greco-Latin term expresses a notion of creation as an act of establishing order out of chaos.[4]</p>

      <h2>What is the World Made of?</h2>
      <p>What is the world made of? Depending on whom you ask, you will get very different answers to that question. To a biologist, the world is made of living organisms. To a chemist, the world is made of molecules formed from atoms. If you ask that question of a physicist, the physicist will probably start by talking about atoms, and then proceed to talk about the protons, neutrons and electrons that make up an atom. However, for particle physicists such as myself, there is no ambiguity in the question. We want to know: what are the fundamental, indivisible building blocks from which all the matter in the universe is made? What are the basic interactions that glue these building blocks together to make the matter we see around us? Is there a finite set of building blocks or is matter like an onion with layer upon layer of inner structure? We do not know the answer to these questions, but we have a fairly consistent picture or model of the world at this most fundamental level that explains all of our experimental results to date. Most of us think that this current picture is incomplete and that there is something deeper and more fundamental lurking behind it. The excitement of our work is that we are constantly probing for the chink in the armor or our current understanding that will reveal some clue of the more profound and fundamental structure beneath.

      <h2>What is the Universe made of?</h2>

      <p>normal matter, 'dark matter' and 'dark energy'. Normal matter consists of the atoms that make up stars, planets, human beings and every other visible object in the Universe.</p>
